racket的 =sicp= package 包含了一个画图工具，可以画出类似书中的效果

#+begin_src scheme
  #lang racket
  (require sicp-pict)
  (define (flipped-pairs painter)
    (let ((painter2 (beside painter (flip-vert painter))))
      (below painter2 painter2)))

  (define (right-split painter n)
    (if (= n 0)
	painter
	(let ((smaller (right-split painter (- n 1))))
	  (beside painter (below smaller smaller)))))

  (define (up-split painter n)
    (if (= n 0)
	painter
	(let ((smaller (up-split painter (- n 1))))
	  (below painter (beside smaller smaller)))))

  (define (corner-split painter n)
    (if (= n 0)
	painter
	(let ((up (up-split painter (- n 1)))
	      (right (right-split painter (- n 1))))
	  (let ((top-left (beside up up))
		(bottom-right (below right right))
		(corner (corner-split painter (- n 1))))
	    (beside (below painter top-left)
		    (below bottom-right corner))))))

  (define (square-limit painter n)
    (let ((quarter (corner-split painter n)))
      (let ((half (beside (flip-horiz quarter) quarter)))
	(below (flip-vert half) half))))

  (paint (square-limit einstein 6))
#+end_src

在 =DrRacket= 的运行效果（只能在DrRacket 运行，在终端无法展示图片）：

配合[[file:exercise2-49.org][wave的实现]]，画出来的效果：
